# First-set-of-excel-tasks
## GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ALL TASKS
Three tasks were assigned within the first week of the Data Analysis Cohort course by Promise Nonso. They were designed to help participants to develop proficiency in Data Manipulation, using Microsoft Excel.
## TASK 1
Create a table of information that consists of 20 rows and 5 columns that will include the following information details: Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department, Salary and Job Type. Make 3 identical sheets of the spreadsheet on the same Excel document and manipulate the data on the sheets as detailed in Tasks 1,2 and 3 below:
